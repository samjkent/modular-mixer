            <h2>Modular Rotary Mixer</h2>
            <p>Eurorack compatible modules for a stereo DJ mixer, with 2.5mm header connections for XLR and line level outputs, cue-ing system with a headphone driver, and VU meters.</p>
            <p>The design is op-amp based, with filters implemented as 12db/oct active inverting filters, 1kohm output impedances, and buffered potentiometes acting as voltage dividers for the controls</p>
            <p>The signal path of the initial 2 band isolator channel design is as follows</p>
            <ul class="signal">
                <li>a line level stereo input </li>
                <li>apply a 2x gain to it  </li>
                <li>pass it through a signal trim pot  </li>
                <li>split the signal with low pass and high pass filters  </li>
                <li>a potentiometer for the low pass, and a potentiometer for the high pass allow the signal to be shaped  </li>
                <li>the remaining signals are summed  </li>
                <li>the summed signal is sent to the channel's outputs; a potentiometer controls how much is sent to the master bus, a button controls whether the signal is sent to the cue bus, and the full signal is sent to the IC controlling the LED level meter</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The signal path of the master channel is simpler, summing together the different audio buses and then outputting the combined signals</p>
            <ul class="signal">
                <li>cue, aux, and master busses enter summing amplifiers; the 1k resistors on the channel outputs ensure that the channels are equally summed</li>
                <li>the master signal is fed into the LED level meter, the cue summing amplifier (via a voltage divider), to a line level buffered output, and a balanced output circuit</li>
                <li>all of these outputs have buffered voltage dividers controlling the level</li>
                <li>the headphone output is op amp based, but when built with a high current op amp such as the Texas Instruments OPA1688 (75mA / channel), it can provide more than enough power to drive monitoring headphones</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The idea is to build a fully customisable system, with N channels that can be mix and matched between isolators, filters, fx units, and traditional eurorack modules</p>
